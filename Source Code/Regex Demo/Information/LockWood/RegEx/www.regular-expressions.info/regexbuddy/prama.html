<H1>404 - The requested page could not be found at regular-expressions.info</H1> <P>The page requested by your web browser could not be found at www.regular-expressions.info. If you clicked on a link to reach this page, that means the link you clicked on is out of date. Please contact the author of the web site that referred you to www.regular-expressions.info to inform him or her of the broken link.</P> <H2>Welcome to Regular-Expressions.info<BR>The Premier Web Site about Regular Expressions</H2> <P>A regular expression, or regex for short, is a special text string for describing a search pattern. You can think of regular expressions as wildcards on steroids. You are probably familiar with wildcards notations such as *.txt to find all text files in a file manager. The regex equivalent is <TT CLASS=regex>.*\.txt</TT>.</P> <P>But you can do much more with regular expressions. In a text editor like <A HREF="editpadpro.html" TARGET="_top">EditPad Pro</A> or a specialized regex tool like <A HREF="powergrep.html" TARGET="_top">PowerGREP</A>, you could use a regular expression like <TT CLASS=regex>\b[A-Z0-9._%-]+@[A-Z0-9._%-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}\b</TT> to find an email address. A very similar regex (replace the first <TT>\b</TT> with <TT>^</TT> and the last one with <TT>$</TT>) can be used in a <A HREF="perl.html" TARGET="_top">Perl</A> or <A HREF="php.html" TARGET="_top">PHP</A> script, or a <A HREF="java.html" TARGET="_top">Java</A> or <A HREF="dotnet.html" TARGET="_top">.NET</A> application to check in just one line of code whether the user entered a properly formatted email address.</P> <H2>Regular Expression Tutorial</H2> <P>Do not worry if the above made very little sense to you. Any non-trivial regex looks daunting to anybody not familiar with them. But with just a bit of experience, you will soon be able to craft your own regular expressions like you have never done anything else. The free <A HREF="tutorial.html" TARGET="_top">Regular-Expressions.info Tutorial</A> explains everything bit by bit.</P> <P>This tutorial is quite unique, because it not only explains the regex syntax, but also describes in detail how the regex engine actually goes about its work. You will learn quite a bit, even if you have already been using regular expressions for some time. This will help you understand quickly why a particular regex does not do what you initially expected. It will save you lots of guesswork and head scratching when you need to write more complex regexes.</P> <H2>Tools &amp; Languages That Support Regexes</H2> <P>There are many software tools and programming languages that support regular expressions these days. It is really impossible to list them all on this web site. Obviously, <A HREF="perl.html" TARGET="_top">Perl</A> deserves to get a full discussion of its regex capabilities. This programming language, originally designed for text-processing only, is the main cause for the popularity that regular expressions enjoy nowadays. The main reason is that Perl's regex engine introduced many new powerful features. Furthermore, regexes are part of the Perl syntax itself, rather than add-on library as with most other languages.</P> <P>Other popular development frameworks, like <A HREF="java.html" TARGET="_top">Java</A> and <A HREF="dotnet.html" TARGET="_top">.NET (dot net)</A> ship with classes that allow you to instantly use regular expressions. Learning regular expressions and using these classes will save you many hours doing similar text processing in your own code without them.</P> <H2>Not Only for Programmers</H2> <P>Even if you are not a programmer, you can still use regular expressions in many situations. They will make finding information a lot easier, and you can use them in powerful search and replace operations to quickly make changes across large numbers of files. A simple example is <TT CLASS=regex>gr[ae]y</TT> which will find both spellings of the word grey in one operation, instead of two. There are many text editors and search and replace tools with decent regex support. Two popular and useful tools are the text editor <A HREF="editpadpro.html" TARGET="_top">EditPad Pro</A> and the all-round regex utility <A HREF="powergrep.html" TARGET="_top">PowerGREP</A>.<DIV CLASS=copyright> <P CLASS=copyright>Page URL: <A HREF="http://www.Regular-Expressions.info/404.html" TARGET="_top">http://www.Regular-Expressions.info/404.html</A><BR> Last Updated: 14 January 2005<BR> Copyright &copy; 2003-2005 Jan Goyvaerts.
