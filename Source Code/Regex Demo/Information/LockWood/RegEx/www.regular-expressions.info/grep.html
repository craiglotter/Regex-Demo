<H1>What Is grep?</H1> <P>Grep is a tool that originated from the UNIX world during the 1970's. It can search through files and folders (directories in UNIX) and check which lines in those files match a given <A HREF="index-2.html" TARGET="_top">regular expression</A>. Grep will output the filenames and the line numbers or the actual lines that matched the regular expression. All in all a very useful tool for locating information stored anywhere on your computer, even (or especially) if you do not really know where to look.</P> <H2>Using grep</H2> <P> If you type <TT>grep regex *.txt</TT> grep will search through all text files in the current folder. It will apply the regex to each line in the files, and print (i.e. display) each line on which a match was found. This means that grep is inherently line-based. Regex matches cannot span multiple lines.</P> <P>If you like to work on the command line, the traditional grep tool will make a lot of tasks easier. All Linux distributions (except tiny floppy-based ones) install a version of grep by default, usually GNU grep. If you are using Microsoft Windows, you will need to download and install it separately. If you use Borland development tools, you already have Borland's Turbo GREP installed.</P> <P>grep not only works with globbed files, but also with anything you supply on the standard input. When used with standard input, grep will print all lines it reads from standard input that match the regex. E.g.: the Linux <TT>find</TT> command will glob the current directory and print all file names it finds, so <TT>find | grep regex</TT> will print only the file names that match regex.</P> <H2>Grep's Regex Engine</H2> <P>Most versions of grep use a regex-directed <A HREF="engine.html" TARGET="_top">engine</A>, like the regex flavors discussed in the <A HREF="tutorial.html" TARGET="_top">regex tutorial</A> on this website . However, grep does not support all the fancy regex features that modern regex flavors support. Usually, support is limited to <A HREF="charclass.html" TARGET="_top">character classes</A> (no shorthands), the <A HREF="dot.html" TARGET="_top">dot</A>, the start and end of line <A HREF="anchors.html" TARGET="_top">anchors</A>, <A HREF="alternation.html" TARGET="_top">alternation</A> with the vertical bar, and greedy repetition with the <A HREF="optional.html" TARGET="_top">question mark</A>, <A HREF="repeat.html" TARGET="_top">star</A> and <A HREF="repeat.html" TARGET="_top">plus</A>. Depending on the version you have, you may need to escape the question mark, plus and vertical bar to give them their special meaning. Originally, grep did not support these metacharacters. They are usually still treated as literal characters when unescaped, for backward compatibility.</P> <P>An enhanced version of grep is called egrep. It uses a <A HREF="engine.html" TARGET="_top">text-directed engine</A>. Since neither grep nor egrep support any of the special features like <A HREF="brackets.html" TARGET="_top">backreferences</A>, <A HREF="repeat.html" TARGET="_top">lazy repetition</A>, or <A HREF="lookaround.html" TARGET="_top">lookaround</A>, and because grep and egrep only indicate whether a match was found on a particular line or not, this distinction does not matter, except that the text-directed engine is faster.</P> <P>GNU grep, the most popular version of grep on Linux, uses both a text-directed and a regex-directed engine. If you use advanced features like backreferences, which GNU grep supports (but not traditional grep and egrep), it will use the regex-directed engine. Otherwise, it uses the faster text-directed engine. Again, for the tasks that grep is designed for, this does not matter to you, the user.</P> <H2>Beyond The Command Line</H2> <P>If you like to work on the command line, then the traditional grep tool is for you. But if you like to use a graphical user interface, there are many grep-like tools available for Windows and other platforms. Simply search for "grep" on your favorite software download site. Unfortunately, many grep tools come with poor documentation, leaving it up to you to figure out exactly which regex flavor they use. It's not because they claim to be Perl-compatible, that they actually are. Some are almost perfectly compatible (but never identical, though), but others fail miserably when you want to use advanced and very useful constructs like <A HREF="lookaround.html" TARGET="_top">lookaround</A>.</P> <P>One Windows-based grep tool that stands out from the crowd is <A HREF="powergrep.html" TARGET="_top">PowerGREP</A>, which I will discuss next.</P><DIV CLASS=copyright> <P CLASS=copyright>Page URL: <A HREF="grep.html" TARGET="_top">http://www.Regular-Expressions.info/grep.html</A><BR> Last Updated: 22 September 2004<BR> Copyright &copy; 2003-2005 Jan Goyvaerts.
